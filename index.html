    <h1>How to Teach Yourself Physics: A very brief, useful guide from an expert in proactivity</h1>
    <p>Hello, this is a quick introduction to myself.</p>
    <p> I'm a fifteen (soon to be sixteen) year old from Boston. I watched one too many episodes of Cosmos, and now I want to be an astrophysicist</p>
   <p> I love cookies n' cream ice cream and kettle corn, also Kirkland Signature dried mango</p>
    <p>Through my incredible disciplinary skills, I was so aware of summer college classes, that I applied for none of them</p>
    <p> now it is way past the deadline, and I am <s>cramming</s> carefully studying physics on my own</p>
    <p> This year, I really hope to qualify for the National Astronomy Competition, so that I can represent the United States in the IOAA! </p>
    <p> I hope with this blog I can look at my progress and reminisce on how easy it used to be</p>
    <p>Thanks for following my incredible blog!</p>

        <p> Today is not the first day of my astrophysics journey, I would say my first day of learning astrophysics (for real, for real!)</p>
        <p> was January 1st, 2025, which was when I began studying for the Science Olympiad!</p>
        <p> the learning curve was horrible. Some days feeling like you really got it, and other days feeling like the dumbest person on the planet</p>
        <p> hopefully physics will go this way for me! Right now, everything is pretty much new to me. I just started on differential equations, and I feel extra dumb today</p>
        <p>I just finished the first chapter of Kleppner and Kolenkow, which is more or less the most difficult textbook I've ever read</p>
        <p> I think what I learned though, is that it's not really that hard until somebody tells you that it's hard.</p>
        <p>I got through it, and I'm like 'yeah this is difficult', but now that I hear that it's infamous I feel even more confused.</p>
        <p> The questions are definitely VERY difficult.</p>

        <p>Here's a wonderful example of a vector problem. As Richard Feynman said: "If you want to master something, teach it." </p>
        <p>Therefore, my 1 loyal viewer will get a wonderful tutorial on how to solve a problem like this one!</p>
        <p>The cosine of the angle between the two vectors would be the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. 
            Basically, you multiply every value (x,y,z) in the vector, and multiply it by the (x,y,z) of the other vector. So if we have vector A(Ax,Ay,Az) and vector B(Bx,By,By)
        you would find the product of each individual component of the vector, so (Ax * Bx, Ay * By, Az * Bz), and then add them together!
        Like so: (Ax*Bx + Ay*By + Az+Bz)
        Now that you know this, you can find the magnitude of the vectors through the pythagorean thereom. I am still very new to programming, so you will have a very terrible version
        of a square root. Hopefully I will learn this in the future. For example, the magnitude of A would be the square root of (Ax^2+Ay^2+Az^2)
        The magnitude of B would be the same. Now that you know the magnitude of A and B, and the dot product, you can find out the cosine of the angle between them!
        The wonderful thing about the dot product is that it's equal to the product of the magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.
        This convenience makes it so that we can just divide the dot product by the product of the magnitudes and find the cosine of the angle between them. Yay!
        You can see my magical work above.</p>

        <p> look at Richard Feynman! isn't he so cute?</p>
