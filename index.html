    <h1>How to Teach Yourself Physics: A very brief, useful guide from an expert in proactivity</h1>
    <p>Hello, this is a quick introduction to myself.</p>
    <p> I'm a fifteen (soon to be sixteen) year old from Boston. I watched one too many episodes of Cosmos, and now I want to be an astrophysicist</p>
   <p> I love cookies n' cream ice cream and kettle corn, also Kirkland Signature dried mango</p>
    <p>Through my incredible disciplinary skills, I was so aware of summer college classes, that I applied for none of them</p>
    <p> now it is way past the deadline, and I am <s>cramming</s> carefully studying physics on my own</p>
    <p> This year, I really hope to qualify for the National Astronomy Competition, so that I can represent the United States in the IOAA! </p>
    <p> I hope with this blog I can look at my progress and reminisce on how easy it used to be</p>
    <p>Thanks for following my incredible blog!</p>

            <p> Captain's log -297636.3404680365</p>
            <p>I'm 90% sure that's what Captain Kirk says.</p>
            <p>Today was a struggle day (everyday is when you're studying physics!)</p>
            <p>I think when people say that physics is easy, they're lying a little bit. Or a lot. Like anybody who thinks that they know quantum mechanics or astrophysics </p>
            <p> has clearly never sat in front of a basic mechanics textbook and studied their butt off! It's hard!!! Anywho, here's what I learned today. Even if I learned a little bit,</p>
            <p>I still have plenty of time to study basic mechanics (8 months), before my massive astrophysics test against the smartest kids in America</p>
            <p>Some people that I know think that they're the smartest kid in America. If I adopt that mindset, maybe I will have the confidence that they have.</p>
            <p>Enough self reflection though! Here's some wonderful physics to teach, Feynman style!</p>

            <p> The hardest part of a physics problem is getting it started. It more or less looks a little bit easy until you figure out the units. That's HARD</p>
            <p> (it's not) One thing I learned from my brand new textbook that was acquired VERY legally is that you have to first tinker around with the units.</p>
            <p> see what works, see what doesnt. See how x affects y, see how mass affects acceleration, yada yada (I'm an expert in vocabulary as you can see!)</p>
            <p>Anywho, a very silly problem that I got started on included escape velocity. Goofing around with the units of Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. Basically, you break it</p>
            <p>down to the fundamental units. I'm not talking acceleration and force. I'm talking units that don't rely on other units. If you think about it, acceleration is m/s^2</p>
            <p>(still figuring out how to have an exponent in my equations lol) however, it all comes down to a couple of silly fundamental units. Mass, length, and time. Pretty much errythang</p>
            <p> is made up of this stuff</p>

    <h2> May 12th, 2025</h2>
    <body>
        <p> Today is not the first day of my astrophysics journey, I would say my first day of learning astrophysics (for real, for real!)</p>
        <p> was January 1st, 2025, which was when I began studying for the Science Olympiad!</p>
        <p> the learning curve was horrible. Some days feeling like you really got it, and other days feeling like the dumbest person on the planet</p>
        <p> hopefully physics will go this way for me! Right now, everything is pretty much new to me. I just started on differential equations, and I feel extra dumb today</p>
        <p>I just finished the first chapter of Kleppner and Kolenkow, which is more or less the most difficult textbook I've ever read</p>
        <p> I think what I learned though, is that it's not really that hard until somebody tells you that it's hard.</p>
        <p>I got through it, and I'm like 'yeah this is difficult', but now that I hear that it's infamous I feel even more confused.</p>
        <p> The questions are definitely VERY difficult.</p>
        <img src="IMG_7322.jpg" alt="chicken scratch" width="500">
        <p>Here's a wonderful example of a vector problem. As Richard Feynman said: "If you want to master something, teach it." </p>
        <p>Therefore, my 1 loyal viewer will get a wonderful tutorial on how to solve a problem like this one!</p>
        <p>The cosine of the angle between the two vectors would be the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. </p>
           <p> Basically, you multiply every value (x,y,z) in the vector, and multiply it by the (x,y,z) of the other vector. So if we have vector A(Ax,Ay,Az) and vector B(Bx,By,By)</p>
        <p>you would find the product of each individual component of the vector, so (Ax * Bx, Ay * By, Az * Bz), and then add them together! </p>
        <p>Like so: (Ax*Bx + Ay*By + Az+Bz)</p>
       <p> Now that you know this, you can find the magnitude of the vectors through the pythagorean thereom. I am still very new to programming, so you will have a very terrible version </p>
        <p>of a radical. Hopefully I will learn this in the future. For example, the magnitude of A would be the square root of (Ax^2+Ay^2+Az^2) </p>
        <p>The magnitude of B would be the same. Now that you know the magnitude of A and B, and the dot product, you can find out the cosine of the angle between them! </p>
        <p>The wonderful thing about the dot product is that it's equal to the product of the magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. </p>
       <p> This convenience makes it so that we can just divide the dot product by the product of the magnitudes and find the cosine of the angle between them. Yay! </p>
        <p>You can see my magical work above.</p>

        <p> look at Richard Feynman! isn't he so cute?</p>
