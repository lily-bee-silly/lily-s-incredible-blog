    <h1>How to Teach Yourself Physics: A very brief, useful guide from an expert in proactivity</h1>
    <p>Hello, this is a quick introduction to myself.</p>
    <p> I'm a fifteen (soon to be sixteen) year old from Boston</p>
    <p> I watched one too many episodes of Cosmos, and now I want to be a physicist</p>
    <p> I love cookies n' cream ice cream and kettle corn, also Kirkland Signature dried mango</p>
    <p>Through my incredible disciplinary skills, I was so aware of summer college classes, that I applied for none of them</p>
    <p> now it is way past the deadline, and I am <s>cramming</s>carefully studying physics on my own</p>
    <p> I hope with this blog I can look at my progress and reminisce on how easy it used to be</p>
    <p>Thanks for following my incredible blog!</p>
