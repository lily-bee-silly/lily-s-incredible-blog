    <h1>How to Teach Yourself Physics: A very brief, useful guide from an expert in proactivity</h1>
    <p>Hello, this is a quick introduction to myself.</p>
    <p> I'm a fifteen (soon to be sixteen) year old from Boston</p>
    <p> I watched one too many episodes of Cosmos, and now I want to be an astrophysicist</p>
    <p> I love cookies n' cream ice cream and kettle corn, also Kirkland Signature dried mango</p>
    <p>Through my incredible disciplinary skills, I was so aware of summer college classes, that I applied for none of them</p>
    <p> now it is way past the deadline, and I am <s>cramming</s> carefully studying physics on my own</p>
    <p> This year, I really hope to qualify for the National Astronomy Competition, so that I can represent the United States in the IOAA! </p>
    <p> I hope with this blog I can look at my progress and reminisce on how easy it used to be</p>
    <p>Thanks for following my incredible blog!</p>

        <p> Today is not the first day of my astrophysics journey, I would say my first day of learning astrophysics (for real, for real!)</p>
        <p> was January 1st, 2025, which was when I began studying for the Science Olympiad!</p>
        <p> the learning curve was horrible. Some days feeling like you really got it, and other days feeling like the dumbest person on the planet</p>
        <p> hopefully physics will go this way for me! Right now, everything is pretty much new to me. I just started on differential equations, and I feel extra dumb today</p>
        <p>I just finished the first chapter of Kleppner and Kolenkow, which is more or less the most difficult textbook I've ever read</p>
        <p> I think what I learned though, is that it's not really that hard until somebody tells you that it's hard.</p>
        <p>I got through it, and I'm like 'yeah this is difficult', but now that I hear that it's infamous I feel even more confused.</p>
        <p> The questions are definitely VERY difficult.</p>
